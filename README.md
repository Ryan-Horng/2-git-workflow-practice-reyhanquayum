## My Thoughts

I found this video interesting for its predictions and picture of the cybersecurity scene in the industry. While short, the speaker gives a good overview of cybersecurity trends and technology trends that are important in the industry. What I found especially interesting were his predictions regarding the use of AI in malicious attacks and how cybersecurity must adapt and predict these methods of attacks with different techniques.
